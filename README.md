# Machine Learning Coursework 

This repo contains the assignments/projects I did for courses I took at University of California, Berkeley and University of Washington. Not updated regurlarly 

## Projects:

- [People You Might Know](https://github.com/weijiazzz/machine-learning-coursework/blob/add_projects/friends_recommendation/friends_recommendation.ipynb): Implemented a *People You Might Know* social network friendship recommendation algorithm in Spark. The key idea is that if two people have a lot of mutual friends, then the system should recommend that they connect with each other

- [Code K-means With PySpark](https://github.com/weijiazzz/machine-learning-coursework/tree/master/kmeans_with_pyspark): K-means is one of the most popular clustering algorithms but training it can be slow. In this project I implemented this technique with PySpark to speed up the training process.

- [Detect YouTube Communities](https://github.com/weijiazzz/machine-learning-coursework/blob/add_projects/community_detection/louvain_algorithm.ipynb): Detected communities on YouTube using the Louvain Algorithm.

-[Association Rules](https://github.com/weijiazzz/machine-learning-coursework/blob/add_projects/association_rules/association_rules.ipynb): Implemented the A-prior Algorithm to find items that are frequently bought together.
